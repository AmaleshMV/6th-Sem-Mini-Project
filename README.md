# 6th-Sem-Mini-Project

A lot of recruits entering in the IT service industries today are initially given the role 
of data entry jobs. These roles, albeit an important process of the company, is not 
suitable for the technically versed graduates looking to prove their worth. Our Dynamic 
Data Entry (DDE) software bot will automate this data entry process, so that the 
employed human resource can be utilized elsewhere more efficiently. This DDE bot 
obtains the data entry items as an excel sheet as input, and it scraps the data from the 
sheet, and dynamically stores it in the required format. And once the entire process is 
over, the bot sends an E-mail to the specified manager indicating the status of task.
This DDE bot can be created using the open source software called UIpath 
community edition, making it cost free for engineering the bot in the first place. Once 
created, it takes an excel sheet as its input, which contains the data to be entered and 
stored. The bot then scrapes the data and stores it dynamically in whichever format 
specified by the company or the client. And there is a built in automation to send an Email to the respective manager/supervisor about the status of the process.
The DDE bot helps employees who are new to the IT industry to be allocated a 
work more suited to their qualifications. And so the productivity and resource 
allocation of the entire organization might improve just a little. Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA) enables us to automate mundane and repetitive tasks with minimal 
or no human intervention. One of the upsides to this is that a software bot never gets 
bored of repetitive tasks, and hence increase the productivity and eases meeting of the 
deadline of that task. RPA provides many tools to be utilized for the creation of 
software bots, such as BluePrism, UIpath, and Automation Anywhere. However, we 
use UIpath as our preferred tool as it has a few more advantages which gives it an edge 
over the other tools. These points include, open source, more powerful in terms of 
capabilities and anyone with little or no knowledge in coding can learn this tool.
